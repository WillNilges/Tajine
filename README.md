# Tajine
A game engine for creating and sharing text-based adventures.


I created Tajine with the goal of making a dead-simple yet effective text adventure creation tool. Tajine allows anyone with a story to tell to write a dynamic choose-your-own-adventure style story using pictures and text (and maybe music soon!).

Tajine is a pair of programs (the editor and the viewer) that can, along with a game (.adfs) file, be distributed to readers quickly with a simple click of a button. Both the viewer and the games are entirely self-contained within one file, so anyone can pick up a copy and hop into an adventure right away.
